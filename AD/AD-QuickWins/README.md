# Active Directory Quick Wins

This project started as a way for me to learn Powershell, inner-workings of AD, and use of the RSAT/PoSh AD module.

It currently serves as a knowledge body in the stead of my script release, with assuredly an improved product coming.
# Trimarc's Quicker Wins

Before I  managed to release the initial draft version of my script, AD Master Sean Metcalf and his company Trimarc had released a very similar script, with better powershell syntax and different types of checks that I would call overall superior. With that in mind, I don't want to release an inferior product for the sake of releasing something, so I'm going to spend some more time including more features and trying to use better PoSh syntax/methods until I consider my AD-QuickWins script superior, thus worth releasing. In the meantime, i'll be listing information about common Active Directory vulnerabilities and resources explaining them. 


Trimarc's script can be found [here](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/webcast-securing-active-directory-performing-your-own-ad-security-review)
